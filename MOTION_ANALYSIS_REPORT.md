### Gaps Identified

| Gap | Severity | Decision Needed |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| ECF header line (auto-generated by court) | Low | Ignore on ingestion, don't include in user templates |
| Filing stamp (clerk stamp vs. electronic) | Medium | Template should accommodate both? Or separate field? |
| Section symbol (§) column alignment | Medium | Must preserve exact spacing in case block table |
| Cause number placement variations | Low | "CIVIL ACTION NO." vs "Cause No." vs "NO." |
| Judicial district blank vs filled | Low | Template placeholder for district number |

### Recommendations for CaseBlockClerk

1. **Add `court_type` field**: Federal vs State affects case block structure
2. **ECF header handling**: Don't include in template—this is court-generated metadata
3. **Filing stamp**: Treat as separate from case block proper (it's prepended by clerk)
4. **Section symbol alignment**: Store as fixed-width table, not flowing text

I.
DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN
```

### Gaps Identified

| Gap | Severity | Decision Needed |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| Salutation line before sections | Medium | "TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:" - Is this CaseBlockClerk or PleadingClerk? |
| Table of Contents generation | High | PleadingClerk needs to auto-generate TOC from structure |
| Paragraph numbering restart vs continuous | High | Current spec handles continuous; need restart-per-section option |
| Section title formatting variations | Medium | "I. INTRODUCTION" vs "I." with title on next line |
| Dotted leaders in TOC | Low | Formatting detail for TOC generation |

### Recommendations for PleadingClerk

1. **Clarify salutation ownership**: "TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE..." should be CaseBlockClerk (it's the end of the salutation pattern)
2. **Add TOC generation capability**: DocumentFormatTemplate needs `include_toc: boolean` and TOC styling options
3. **Paragraph numbering modes**:
   - `continuous`: 1, 2, 3... through entire document
   - `per_section`: Restart at 1 for each Roman numeral section
   - `none`: No paragraph numbers
4. **Section title placement**: Template option for inline ("I. INTRODUCTION") vs stacked format

---

## Pass 3: Formatting Variations

### Footer Patterns Found

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Simple page number | `Page 1` |
| Page X of Y | `Page 1 of 7` |
| Federal with PageID | `Page 1 of 7 PageID 1377` |
| Title + Page | `PLAINTIFFS' ORIGINAL PETITION AND REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE – Page 1 of 11` |
| Title + Page (dash style) | `PLAINTIFF'S ORIGINAL PETITION - Page 1 of 13` |
| Centered simple | `Page 2 of 9` |

### Formatting Levers Confirmed Needed

All levers in PleadingClerk's DocumentFormatTemplate are confirmed:
- ✅ Page numbering format
- ✅ Footer left/center/right content
- ✅ Motion title in footer
- ✅ First page different

### Additional Formatting Observations

| Observation | Current Spec | Gap? |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| Line numbering (left margin) | Not specified | **Yes** - Some courts require numbered lines |
| Double-spacing throughout | Specified | No |
| Block quote indentation | Specified | No |
| Footnote placement | Specified | No |

### Recommendations

1. **Add line numbering lever**: Some courts require numbered lines in left margin (1-28 per page)
2. **Footer generation is complex**: Need to handle `{{motion_title}}` placeholder in footer that pulls from document title

## Pass 4: Citations

### Exhibit Citation Patterns Found

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Simple with Bates | `See Ex. 3 (000018)` |
| Multiple exhibits | `See Exhibits 1 and 2` |
| Exhibit with section | `See Exhibit 4 at §4-12-2` |
| Exhibit with page range | `Exhibit A at 31-33` |
| Deposition transcript | `Exhibit B at 28:22-29:10` |
| Attached reference | `attached as Exhibit 1` |

### Case Law Citation Patterns Found

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Texas LEXIS | `2012 Tex. Dist. LEXIS 31 (Tex.Dist.Ct. 2012)` |
| Texas App | `2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 3472 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth Apr. 9, 2015)` |
| Federal Reporter | `874 F.3d 425, 428–29 (5th Cir. 2017)` |
| Federal District | `188 F.R.D. 478, 479-80 (E.D. Ky. 1999)` |
| US Supreme Court | `461 U.S. 660, 672 (1983)` |

### Statute/Rule Citation Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Texas Rule | `TEX. R. CIV. P. 47(c)` |
| Texas Rule (lowercase) | `Tex.R.Civ.P. 198` |
| Texas Code | `Tex. Educ. Code § 37.153` |
| Texas CPRC | `§15.001 et seq. of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code` |
| Federal Rule | `Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)` |

### Gaps Identified

| Gap | Severity | Decision Needed |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| Bates numbering format | Medium | ExhibitsClerk needs to support `(000018)` format for page references |
| Deposition transcript citations | High | Different from regular page citations - need line number support |
| "See" vs "see" capitalization | Low | Citation formatting rule based on position in sentence |
| Citation pinpoint formats | Medium | Page, section (§), paragraph (¶), line numbers |

### Recommendations for ExhibitsClerk

1. **Add Bates numbering support**: Store Bates range for document/pages
2. **Deposition transcript mode**: page:line format (e.g., "28:22-29:10")
3. **Citation template options**:
   - `See Exhibit A`
   - `See Ex. A`
   - `Ex. A`
   - `Exhibit A`
   - With/without Bates numbers
   - With/without page/section pinpoints

### Recommendations for CaseLawClerk

1. **Multiple reporter support**: Same case may have parallel citations
2. **Pinpoint type detection**: Page vs section vs paragraph
3. **Short form recognition**: `Id.`, `Id. at 460`, case name short forms

## Architecture Validation

### What Works As-Is ✅

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Hierarchy invariant | ✅ Works | All motions fit section → subsection → paragraph model |
| ExhibitsClerk exhibit objects | ✅ Works | Dynamic markers, title pages confirmed needed |
| CaseLawClerk citation types | ✅ Works | Cases, statutes, rules all found |
| SignatureClerk basic model | ✅ Works | Templates capture variations |
| AttachmentsClerk certificates | ✅ Works | Certificate patterns confirmed |
| DocumentFormatTemplate levers | ✅ Mostly works | Need TOC and line numbering additions |

### What Needs Enhancement ⚠️

| Component | Enhancement Needed |
|-----------|-------------------|
| PleadingClerk | TOC generation, paragraph numbering modes, line numbering |
| ExhibitsClerk | Bates numbering, deposition transcript citations |
| CaseBlockClerk | Court type field, salutation clarification |
| SignatureClerk | Multiple attorneys support |
| AttachmentsClerk | Service method checkboxes |

### No Architecture Changes Needed ✅

The 8-clerk model is **validated**. All motion patterns fit within the established clerk boundaries. The gaps identified are **enhancements within existing clerks**, not new clerks or restructuring.
